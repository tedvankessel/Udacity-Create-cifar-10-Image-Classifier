# Udacity-Create-cifar-10-Image-Classifier

## Introduction 

### From the course documentation:
You are a new machine learning engineer at a self-driving car startup. Management is trying to decide whether to build or buy an object detection algorithm for objects that may be on the side of the road. They are considering buying a computer vision algorithm from a company called Detectocorp. Detectocorpâ€™s algorithm claims a 70% accuracy rate on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a benchmark used to evaluate the state of the art for computer vision systems.

But before making this purchase, management wants to explore whether you can build an in-house solution that performs well. They have asked you to try your hand at creating a neural network that can classify arbitrary objects and potentially be fine-tuned on a larger dataset using transfer learning.

## Code
The code for this project is fully embodied in the **CIFAR-10_Image_Classifier.ipynb** Jupyter Notebook file in this Github repository.

### The python version used in this code is:

	Python version
	3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 20:23:39) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]
	Version info.
	sys.version_info(major=3, minor=7, micro=6, releaselevel='final', serial=0)

>See below for more details on environment etc. 

## Datasets
The following datasets were recommended by Udacity for use in this project:
